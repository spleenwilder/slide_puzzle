# slide_puzzle

This is one of those puzzles where you navigate through a maze,
but you can't stop moving in the current direction until you hit a
wall. It's written for Windows, and uses the Windows terminal 
to display all game info.

It's currently configured for a 120 x 30 terminal window, but this 
and other settings can be changed in the config.hpp file. The 
MapData.cpp file is where new levels are created and loaded 
into the game.
